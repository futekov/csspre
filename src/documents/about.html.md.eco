CSS PRE is your one-stop reference for the most popular CSS Preprocessors - <a href="http://lesscss.org/" target="_blank">Less</a>, <a href="http://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">Sass</a>, <a href="http://stylus-lang.com/" target="_blank">Stylus</a> and <a href="https://github.com/postcss/postcss">PostCSS</a>.

[Contribute on GitHub](<%- @site.github %>) to make the site better. 

## Syntax and Features

The code examples for Sass on this site use both the [indented syntax](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.INDENTED_SYNTAX.html) and the CSS-based SCSS syntax.

If you are using Sass you can choose to compile with either Ruby Sass or LibSass, the former is written in Ruby (obviously), the latter is a C/C++ implementation and is way faster; another differences is in the Sass features they support, [Hugo Giraudel](http://hugogiraudel.com/) has built a nice [Sass compatibility table](http://sass-compatibility.github.io/) if you need to check those out.

Stylus allows extreme freedom in terms of syntax - we can omit braces, semicolons, and even colons. To be future-proof, this site will only show Stylus snippets with colons (omitting semicolons and braces) and by prepening each variable with the currently [optional](http://stylus-lang.com/docs/variables.html) `$` sign (this is [how Stylus will most likely work in the future](https://github.com/stylus/stylus/wiki/1.0.0#what-to-change-in-syntax)). I advise you to read Stylus' resources on [what is allowed in terms of syntax](http://stylus-lang.com/docs/selectors.html).

## Versions

This site is closely tied to CodePen, as a result all code is written to be compatible with the versions of the preprocessors that CodePen supports - [Less](http://codepen.io/versions/#less-version), [Sass](http://codepen.io/versions/#sass-version), [Stylus](http://codepen.io/versions/#stylus-version), and [PostCSS](http://codepen.io/versions/#postcss-version).

## Thanks to

[The great people at CodePen](http://codepen.io/about/), thanks to them all code snippets can be launched in a new tab and played around with.
